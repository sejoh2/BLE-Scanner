# 🛰️ Flutter BLE Smart Device Scanner

A clean, modern, and fully functional Flutter application that scans for nearby **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** devices, displays them in a categorized list, and allows users to connect to and explore their Bluetooth services.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Requirements

Before running this app, ensure you have:

- [Flutter SDK 3.0+](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code
- An Android device with **Bluetooth enabled**
- Nearby BLE-enabled devices (e.g., Smartwatch, Earbuds, BLE Sensor)

> ⚠️ Note: BLE features require a physical device — emulators typically do not support Bluetooth.

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sejoh2/BLE-Scanner.git
cd bleconnect


3️⃣ Install Dependencies
flutter pub get

4️⃣ Run the Application
flutter run

📱 App Overview

This project implements BLE scanning and device connection using the flutter_blue_plus
 package.
It displays all nearby BLE devices and allows users to connect, disconnect, and view their services and signal strength.

🧠 State Management — Why Provider?

This project uses Provider for state management because it provides:

A clean separation between UI and business logic

Automatic UI updates when BLE scan results or connection state change

Lightweight and scalable architecture for handling multiple BLE devices

Provider Usage

BLEService — handles Bluetooth scanning, connection, and service discovery using flutter_blue_plus.

BLEProvider — listens to BLEService, manages device list, and exposes scan/connect states to the UI.

LandingPage and ConnectPage use context.watch<BLEProvider>() to update the UI reactively.
💡 Tip: Run on a real Android phone for accurate Bluetooth scanning and connections.

🧩 Core Functionalities

✅ Continuous BLE Scanning — Scans for nearby BLE devices until user presses “Stop Scan”
✅ Device Filtering — Users can filter results by category: “All”, “Audio Devices”, “Smart Watches”
✅ Signal Strength Display — Shows real-time RSSI strength using signal bars
✅ Device Connection — Connect/disconnect from devices and explore services
✅ Responsive UI — Built with clean Material Design and dynamic updates

🧰 Key Code Files Explained
🔹 device_tile.dart

Displays a single Bluetooth device (icon, name, MAC address, and signal strength).

Tapping navigates to ConnectPage.

🔹 landing_page.dart

Main screen showing all scanned BLE devices.

Includes category filters and start/stop scan button.

Integrates with BLEProvider for live updates.

🔹 connect_page.dart

Displays selected device details and connection status.

Allows users to connect/disconnect and view available services.

Uses a modern UI with progress indicators and error handling.

🔹 ble_service.dart

Wraps all Bluetooth operations:

Start/stop scanning

Manage connections

Discover services

Listen to Bluetooth adapter state

🔹 ble_provider.dart

Provides reactive state management via Provider.

Tracks isScanning, isConnected, and the list of discovered devices.

⚙️ Challenges Faced

BLE Device Names Not Displaying

Many BLE peripherals don’t advertise a name field.

The app gracefully falls back to showing the MAC address instead.

Managing Bluetooth Permissions

Android 12+ requires explicit permissions (BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION).

Tested and verified runtime permission requests.

Limited Emulator Support

BLE scanning cannot be tested on emulators — used nRF Connect app to verify BLE broadcasts.

🧠 Assumptions Made

BLE is tested only on Android (iOS permissions differ).

Scanning stops only when manually triggered.

Unknown devices are still displayed with their MAC address and RSSI.

Device filtering is based on name keywords (e.g., “watch”, “buds”).


🌟 Bonus Features Implemented

✅ Continuous scanning

✅ Signal strength visualization (RSSI bars)

✅ Device category filters

✅ Clean separation of logic and UI using Provider

✅ Modern, minimal UI with responsive updates

✅ Custom error handling with SnackBars


🧾 How to Test the App

Install the app on a physical Android device.

Turn on Bluetooth and allow location permissions.

Press “Start Scan” — nearby BLE devices will appear.

Tap any device to open the Connect Page.

Press “Connect” to establish a BLE connection.

View its services and signal strength.

Press “Disconnect” to close the session.
